## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Disclaimer

### Fresh Install Requirement

**This configuration is tailored for a FRESH INSTALL of VANILLA ARCH LINUX using the archinstall script with the Hyprland profile.** We strongly advise against attempting this installation on derivative distributions (such as CachyOS, Manjaro, etc.) as package and configuration conflicts are highly likely. This includes packages you could install yourself, through Arch's repo, and a few AUR packages. This will install the chaotic AUR, the only AUR exclusive package that is installed, is the Noctalia bar itself. 

### Development Status

This script, is now released. It is no longer in beta state. This project originally started as a vibe coded project to see what we could get away with. It quickly turned into only being an outline, as A.I is too frustrating to deal with after more than 80 lines of code. The rest, is completely scripted by tonekneeo, and myself.

### Lua Update

The initial .lua files have been added if you want to start using them. For now you need to manually replace your .conf files with the files in the new lua folder.

Make sure you are on Noctalia-shell version 4.7.7 before attempting to use the lua files.

After running the script replace the .conf files with the new .lua files, reboot, enjoy.

Until Noctalia is completely updated you will have to manually change the color codes in the noctalia-colors.lua file in the ~/.config/hypr/noctalia to match your color-scheme for window borders.

NVIDIA Users: On line 32 of the startup.lua change local enable_nvidia_optional = false to local enable_nvidia_optional = true

### What this does

This script turns a fresh Arch + Hyprland setup into the minimaLinux desktop by installing required packages, dropping useless ones and adding preconfigured streamlined dotfiles.

### Nvidia Users

Once in the system open ~/.config/hypr/startup.conf and uncomment the Nvidia section then reboot.

### Credits

The primary application bar (`noctalia-shell`) is based on the exceptional work by **Noctalia**. All credit for the bar's design and functionality goes to them:

## ⚙️ Customization Required

These dotfiles are provided strictly as a **template**. You **must** review and customize several files to align with your specific hardware, desired aesthetics, and system paths.

| File/Section | Customization Needed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`hypr/hyprland.conf`** | Monitor setup (resolution, scaling, refresh rate). | The current default is `monitor=,preferred,auto,1`. You may use `nwg-displays` to help configure and export precise settings. |
| **`hypr/keybinds.conf`** | Set bindings here. | Super+E is to open your file explorer. Super+D is the app launcher. |
| **Theming** | Color schemes, fonts, and global aesthetic settings. | The default theme is minimal. Customize these within Noctalia's settings, go to color scheme, and then templates, you can set kitty, GTK, or whatever else you would like to match your color scheme. |
| *NOTE ON THEMING* | adw-gtk3-dark | This will be needed to make changes to GTK. This comes preinstalled, you will have to set it in GTK Settings. |
| **`fastfetch/config.jsonc`** | Theming/Images. | Update the configuration for your specific image or ASCII art display. |

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

You must be running an **Arch-based Linux distribution** and have basic development tools installed (`git` is required for cloning).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Echilonvibin/minimaLinux.git
```

### Step 2: Change directory to the repo
```bash
cd ./minimaLinux
```

### Step 3: Make the install script executable

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the install script, YIPPE
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Additional Install Notes

For extra setup and troubleshooting details (including Arch ISO Wi-Fi setup before archinstall), see [InstallNotes.md](InstallNotes.md).


Note: The install.sh script handles package installation via your package manager and deploys the dotfiles. Any existing config files that would be overwritten are first backed up with a `.bak.<timestamp>` suffix in `~/.config`, allowing `uninstall.sh` to restore them later.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you need to revert the changes, navigate to the repository directory and run:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will restore any backed-up config files found in `~/.config` to their previous state.

> **Note:** Installed packages are **not** automatically removed. If you wish to uninstall them, you will need to do so manually via `pacman` or `yay`.
